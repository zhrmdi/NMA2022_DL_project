# NMA2022-project
Deep learning project for NMA 2022: **Modelling how the brain deals with noisy input.** <br/> Based on NMA's [Vision with Lost Glasses](https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/projects/Neuroscience/blurry_vision.html) project. 

## Objective

<p align="justify"> How visual system in the brain solves noisy object classification? <br/> Imagine you lost your spectacle and the world around you is completely blurred out. As you stumble around, you see a small animal walk towards you. Can you figure out what it is? Probably yes, right? In this situation, or in foggy/night-time conditions, visual input is of poor quality; images are blurred and have low contrast and yet our brains manage to recognize it. Is it possible to model the process? Does previous experience help? </p>
