Deep learning project for NMA 2022.
Vision with Lost Glasses: Modelling how the brain deals with noisy input.

## Objective

Imagine you lost your spectacle and the world around you is completely blurred out. As you stumble around, you see a small animal walk towards you. Can you figure out what it is? Probably yes right?

In this situation, or in foggy/night-time conditions, visual input is of poor quality; images are blurred and have low contrast and yet our brains manage to recognize it. Is it possible to model the process? Does previous experience help?
